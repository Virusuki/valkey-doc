Delete all the keys of the currently selected DB.
This command never fails.

By default, `FLUSHDB` will synchronously flush all keys from the database.
Setting the **lazyfree-lazy-user-flush** configuration directive to "yes" changes the default flush mode to asynchronous.

It is possible to use one of the following modifiers to dictate the flushing mode explicitly:

* `ASYNC`: flushes the database asynchronously
* `!SYNC`: flushes the database synchronously

Note: an asynchronous `FLUSHDB` command only deletes keys that were present at the time the command was invoked. Keys created during an asynchronous flush will be unaffected.
